### About

Checkpoints NFT is a (WIP) crowd-sourcing platform built on top of the SURF.Finance ecosystem for game developers, writers, and other types of creatives that lets their supporters build with them by buying creative choices. In the centralized creative industry, a lot of the creative freedom is owned by corporations and not the artists. This model aims to give creators as much flexibility as they want while also creating a space for them to engage and fund their projects.Â This can be anything ranging from your name appearing in the credits, naming things inside the game, to picking how certain things work in a story, or as much creative freedom as the creator is willing to give.

Some examples of what could be minted:  
\- Picking the name of a city in a game  
\- Writing a loved one's name in a tombstone of a graveyard in a game as a memorial  
\- Advertisement inside the game without breaking immersion  
\- Creative decisions such as color of a flag or house  
\- The topic of the next video for a content creator  
\- Any sort of metadata that can be stored in a string or number
